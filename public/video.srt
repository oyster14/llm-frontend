1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,060
All right, round one.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,030
Here.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,070
Got it.
Okay.

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,780
Ready, set,

5
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,490
go.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,900
Uh, box?

7
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,410
Uh,

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,810
window?

9
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,110
Batman.

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,910
LEONARD:
Batman and Robin.

11
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,120
Uh, Wonder Twins
plus the monkey.

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,150
Wonder Twins plus
the monkey <i>and</i> Batman.

13
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,160
A gift? Present!

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,340
Present! Yeah!

15
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,950
Oh...
Leonard.

16
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,630
Now, how can you not get that?

17
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,690
In what universe
is that a present?

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,150
It's not <i>a</i> present,

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,270
it's <i>the</i> present. Look.

20
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,970
There's you and me.

21
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,510
It's Penny and Amy.

22
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,940
We're playing Pictionary.

23
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,250
In the present.

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,290
Oh, my God, we're
gonna kill them.

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,790
It's a quark-gluon plasma.

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,640
No.

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,580
It's asymptotically free partons

28
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,200
inside a quark-gluon plasma.

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,670
Nothing with quarks.

30
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,470
It's an observational rebuttal

31
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,170
of the Lambda-CDM model
of the universe!

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,320
No!
